     Task 1
     Create a class Man, the class should describe a person and contain the properties name, age, passport, sex.
     Create a man object based on it. Print the object to the console.

     Task 2
     Create an Employer class that will inherit from Man.
     The class must contain fields create - start date, salary.
     Create an employer object based on Employer. Fill in the fields, output to the console.

     Task 3
     Add a render method to the Man class, which will display all the fields of the object created based on the Man class (in paragraphs).

     Task 4
     Apply the render method to man and output its contents to .out-1.

     Task 5
     Apply the render method to the employer and output its contents to .out-2. As you can see, the create, salary fields are not displayed.

     Task 6
     Since the Employer's render method does not display all the new fields, it is desirable to add them.
     First, let's do it head-on - just create the render method again in Employer (copy it from Man) and add new fields to the "front". Make sure the method works.

     Task 7
     But, overwriting methods is a so-so idea, what's the point of inheritance then?
     Let's try to complete the method. Comment out the render method in Employer. Now write:

     render(x) {
         super.render(x);
         and here is your code that outputs new fields to object x
     }
     As you can see, super allows you to access the methods of the parent class!

     Task 8
     Create a getter for the Employer to get the name of the client.
     The name property itself, change it to _name. Showcase your work.

     Task 9
     Create a setter for the Employer to store the customer's name in the _name property.
     The setter should check the name against a string, trim spaces. Showcase your work.
